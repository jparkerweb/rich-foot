## 🚀 Code Refactoring

### v1.11.1
#### 📦 Update
- Optimized CSS for rending `rich foot` element at the bottom of notes

### v1.11.0
This release represents a complete architectural overhaul of the Rich Foot plugin, implementing modern best practices and significant performance improvements.

#### ✨ Performance Enhancements
- Implemented `requestAnimationFrame` for all visual updates to eliminate page jitter
- Optimized MutationObserver usage with RAF-debounced callbacks
- Added CSS `contain` and `will-change` properties for better rendering performance
- Reduced layout thrashing through batched DOM operations
- Smart update detection to skip unnecessary re-renders

#### 🏗️ Architecture Improvements
- Complete code reorganization with separation of concerns
- New modular structure:
  - **RichFootDataManager**: Handles all data fetching and parsing
  - **RichFootRenderer**: Pure rendering logic with optimal DOM operations
  - **RichFootViewManager**: View lifecycle and observer management
- Eliminated code duplication across date parsing and link creation
- Cleaner, more maintainable codebase with JSDoc documentation

#### 🧹 Cleanup & Stability
- Proper resource cleanup using Obsidian's `registerEvent` exclusively
- Improved observer management with automatic disconnection
- Data attributes for better element tracking
- No more manual event cleanup in `onunload` (automatic via registration)
- Fixed potential memory leaks from orphaned observers

#### 🔧 Compatibility
- Enhanced native hover preview integration (works in all modes)
- Respects view lifecycle changes more accurately

#### 📊 Code Quality
- Comprehensive error handling with try-catch blocks
- Modern ES6+ patterns throughout
- Clear naming conventions and documentation

#### 🎨 CSS Optimizations
- Added GPU-accelerated transforms for animations
- Optimized transitions with `will-change` hints
- Layout containment for better performance
- Smoother fade-in animations

This update maintains 100% backwards compatibility with all existing settings and configurations while providing a more robust, performant foundation for future enhancements.
